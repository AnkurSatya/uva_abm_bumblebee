README

The bumblebee_evolution folder contain the code for the project of group 16, for the Agent Based Modelling course in the University of Amsterdam.
The goal of the project is to study, using an agent based model, the reproductive succes of the bumblebees, in the scenario in which they are able to switch role at the end of the day (or, from another point of view, to communicate to the hive, which type of bee should be produced).

In particular every bee will take account of the encountered bees during the day (from both its hive and the other hives)

In the following code, 3 main parameters are crucial:

1. the ratio between workers and males/queens (so-called "forager_royal_ratio")
2. the weight that a bee gives to the bee of its own hive (so-called "alpha") (1-alpha is the weight to the bee of another hive)
3. the percentage of nectar used at the end of the day to create new offspring (so-called "growth_factor")

Moreover, it's possible to change other variables in the code, such as the grid-size, the time-steps or the number of hives. As well as the total amount of nectar in the environment and its variability in the simulation.
